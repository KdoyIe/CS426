Use POV Ray to create an animated sequence of your choice with the following
requirements.

The code should make use of commands such as object, difference and union to build at least one complicated object using simpler primitives.

The idea should be original.
It should not be an exact rework of an online tutorial or of the handout.

Either the camera or the object should move during the animation sequence.
